# Interactive Markdown Demo

This post demonstrates how to use custom React components in your Markdown content. Enhanced Markdown allows you to combine the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components.

## Interactive Counter Component

Below is an interactive counter component that maintains state:

{/* <Counter /> */}

Try clicking the buttons above to increase or decrease the counter. This component is defined in `src/components/mdx/Counter.tsx`.

## Callout Component

You can also use custom components to create styled callouts for important information:

{/* <Callout type="info" title="Information">
  This is an informational callout that can be used to highlight important details.
</Callout> */}

{/* <Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
  Be careful! This warning callout draws attention to important precautions.
</Callout> */}

{/* <Callout type="error" title="Error">
  Something went wrong! Use this error callout to highlight critical issues.
</Callout> */}

{/* <Callout type="success" title="Success">
  Well done! This success callout celebrates achievements or confirms successful operations.
</Callout> */}

## Code Blocks

Markdown also supports code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Tables

You can create tables in Markdown:

| Framework | Learning Curve | Performance | Community Support |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| React     | Moderate       | High        | Excellent         |
| Vue       | Low            | High        | Good              |
| Angular   | High           | Good        | Excellent         |
| Svelte    | Low            | Excellent   | Growing           |
